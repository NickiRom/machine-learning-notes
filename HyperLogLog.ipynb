    "### Setup\n",
    "1. Map input elements $x$ to a range $[0; 2^L-1]$ for hash length L\n",
    "2. The output is $$y = \\sum_{k\\ge0}bit(y,k)2^k$$ where $k^{th}$ bit is represented by bit(y,k)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define a function $$\\rho(y) = \\min_{k\\ge0} bit(y,k) \\ne 0$$ which gives the location of the least significant 1-bit in $y$.  Note that the position is 0-indexed, and $\\rho(0) = L$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The probability of $y$ consisting of:\n",
    "$$ P\\left(y |bit(y,k) = \\begin{cases}1 & k = L-1 \\\\ 0 & k \\le L-1 \\end{cases} \\right) = 2^{-(k+1)}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize a bit-vector of length L with all 0's\n",
    "2. Iterate through elements x of multiset M\n",
    "3. For each x, set bit-vector[index] = 1 for $index = \\rho(hash(x))$\n",
    "4. Let R be the index of the least significant bit of the bit-vector that remains 0 \n",
    "5. Calculate the # distinct elements as $$\\frac{2^R}{0.77351}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inaccuracies\n",
    "- Since algorithm produces variable results, take a set of n measurements and break into r groups\n",
    "- For each measurement in group $r_i$, take the median of the measurements\n",
    "- Combine the r medians by taking the mean"
