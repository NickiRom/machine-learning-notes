    "# Post-processing Calibration of Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Motivation\n",
    "- A probabilistic model for binary outcomes attempts to (i) rank-order records in order of probability. In addition, the output probability should be calibrated to (ii) reflect the actual % of the time a record with those features will encounter a successful outcome.  \n",
    "- When a model has successfully accomplished (i) and not (ii), it is often computationally inefficient or algorithmically difficult to calibrate the model itself.\n",
    "- Instead, calibration can be accomplished in a post-processing step that does not affect the rank-order output of a model, but does adjust the probability to reflect the actual Bayesian posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutability:**  Calibration never changes the rank-order of records' predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametricity:**  Can be either [**parametric**](#parametric) (see Platt's method) or non-parametric (see isotonic regression and histogram binning)\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. Quantile Binning\n",
    "A non-parametric method\n",
    "\n",
    "** Steps: **\n",
    "1. Raw predictions are sorted from lowest to highest\n",
    "2. Partitioned into pre-defined number of equal-sized bins\n",
    "3. In each bin, the fraction of positive outcomes is calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "** Limitations: **\n",
    "- must pre-define number of bins, regardless of data skew\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. Isotonic Regression\n",
    "A non-parametric method that requires mapping function to be monotonically increasing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/isotonic.png' width=300 height=300>\n",
    "** Types of isotonic regression **\n",
    "- Pool adjacent violators (PAV), a binning algorithm in which the size and placement of bins is decided by how well the classifier ranked the training data\n",
    "- [**Sklearn implementation**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/plot_isotonic_regression.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "** Limitations: **\n",
    "The [**isotonicity**](#isotonic) assumption is frequently violated\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. Bayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ)\n",
    "A non-parametric method that does not require isotonicity and considers multiple binning options\n",
    "\n",
    "** Limitations: **\n",
    "Bins must be of equal frequency (e.g. all deciles, all quantiles, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## VI. Platt's Method\n",
    "A parametric method that fits probabilities to a sigmoid to learn shape parameters (essentially a logistic regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "** Limitations: **\n",
    "Not as powerful as Isotonic Regression when training data is available\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appendix: Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calibration\n",
    "- a model is calibrated when outcomes predicted to occur with probability $p$ actually occur at a rate of about $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='isotonic'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Isotonic\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monotonically increasing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reliability Curve\n",
    "- Displays calibration of a model by plotting predicted probability against observed rate of success\n",
    "<img src=\"images/reliability_curve.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='parametric'></a>\n",
    "#### Parametric\n",
    "- maps to an assumed distribution of probabilities.  For example, posterior probabilities can be fit to a Sigmoid curve for the purposes of calibration.\n"
