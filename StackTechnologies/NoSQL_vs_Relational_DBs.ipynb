    "# Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "#### PostGreSQL\n",
    "- have 4-5 different kinds of indexing (nearest neighbor, BTrees, GIS, etc)\n",
    "- has a feature to cluster on index, allowing you to reorganize data to get all rows with same index together\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### components\n",
    "#### Primary key\n",
    "    - uses an index to figure out what you want to read, instead of scanning all rows like Hadoop\n",
    "    - only difference between primary key and index is that a primary key is necessarily unique\n",
    "#### Foreign key\n",
    "#### indexing\n",
    "#### Partial indexing\n",
    "- can only be done by some modern databases\n",
    "- is a subset of indices that are used frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACID\n",
    "#### A: all operations are atomic\n",
    "#### C: consistent\n",
    "    - always returns the same thing\n",
    "    - to do this, often need to use one large machine \n",
    "#### I: isolated\n",
    "    - can block off portions of the table until it's updated properly (so no queries are run until then)\n",
    "    - opposite is \"read uncommitted\", where you want the most recent data even if it's not updated\n",
    "#### D: durable\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it's stored\n",
    "- two files: one index, one data\n",
    "- partition because index grows exponentially and want to keep that small (and in memory)\n",
    "- indices use BTrees to hash\n",
    "- Btrees and Rtrees are more complex versions.  See QuadTrees for videogames\n",
    "- you'll find spaces in the files because disk allocation is done before all data is added.  Can later add to an index\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading data\n",
    "- faster for sequential data reads (if doesn't need to skip)\n",
    "- if your column choice is closer to left, the data is only read up to that column so it's faster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hadoop/Hive\n",
    "- is ACID-compliant\n",
    "- we invested in HDFS, so we use Spark with Druid instead of Cassandra\n",
    "- is not a database, is a file system with metadata on top of it to act like a database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "#### HDFS\n",
    "#### Map Reduce\n",
    "#### YARN (yet another resource allocator/something)\n",
    "- can help you read using something other than Map Reduce, for example, because it's slow\n",
    "#### Spark\n",
    "- an in-memory database instead of Map Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "### How data is stored\n",
    "- all data is replicated 3 times on 3 servers\n",
    "- mapping process: mapper delegates reads, collects data without sorting with only basic filtering\n",
    "- they're brought together to a reducer, where non-partitioned where clauses are met\n",
    "\n",
    "### File types\n",
    "- sequence file\n",
    "- Avro\n",
    "- json compressed (better than XML, but slowest otherwise)\n",
    "- Parquet\n",
    "    - about half the size of json compressed\n",
    "    - has a SerDe so that when mapper accesses part of data, knows what to ignore (to make reading faster)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### examples\n",
    "- cassandra\n",
    "    - is eventually consistent (because write servers are distributed around, need to update all others), is durable\n",
    "    - columnar storage\n",
    "    - multiple write servers\n",
    "    - useful for OLAP\n",
    "    - columns can be compressed by noting repeats, differentials, run-length encoding, etc.\n",
    "- MongoDB\n",
    "    - a document database (stores as json)\n",
    "    - doesn't have durability or consistency. If it fails, it fails\n",
    "    - master/slave configuration\n",
    "    - only one write server, rest are read servers.  So good for quickly reading content like serving web pages\n",
    "    - good to serve content, but for transactions keep one large machine (relational DB) for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Action items\n",
    "### Query accelerator\n",
    "- Steve is spearheading, but this isn't designed for us to use yet\n",
    "- a use case for this would be realtime dashboards for our products, but not if we need super low latency refreshes.  This is more for OLAP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spinning up AWS cluster\n",
    "- Steve needs use cases for this\n",
    "- but anything that needs to run Spark for a small amount of time every few hours could use this\n",
